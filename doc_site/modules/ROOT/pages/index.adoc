dracut is a modular tool which generates an initial image capable of loading
necessary drivers and performing other configuration during early Linux boot.

== The early boot environment

Most Linux distributions ship a single, generic kernel image that is intended
to boot a wide variety of hardware. The device drivers for this generic kernel
image are included as loadable modules, as it is not practical to statically
compile them all into the one kernel without making it excessively large.
However, this then raises the problem of detecting and loading the device
driver modules necessary to mount the root file system at boot time (or, for
that matter, deducing where or what the root file system is).

To further complicate matters, the root file system may be on a software RAID
volume, LVM, NFS (on diskless workstations), or on an encrypted partition. All
of these require special preparations to mount.  Another complication is kernel
support for hibernation, which suspends the computer to disk by dumping an
image of the entire system to a swap partition or a regular file, then
powering off. On next boot, this image has to be made accessible before it can
be loaded back into memory.

To avoid having to hardcode many special cases into the kernel, an initial boot
stage with a temporary root file system — now dubbed early user space — is
used.  This root file system contains user-space helpers that do the hardware
detection, module loading and device discovery necessary to get the "real" root
file system mounted, which the kernel then "pivots" onto to continue the boot
process.

An image of this initial root file system (along with the kernel image) must be
stored somewhere accessible by the Linux bootloader or the boot firmware of the
computer.  This is usally partition on a local disk (a _boot partition_) or
perhaps remotely via a TFTP server (on systems that can boot from Ethernet).
The bootloader will load the kernel and initial root file system image into
memory and then start the kernel, passing in the memory address of the image.

== initrd and initramfs

_initrd_ and _initramfs_ are two related but different methods of creating the
early user space environment.  Both achieve similar goals of allowing the
kernel to find the main root device, but operate differently.

In short, _initrd_ is a block device image, while an _initramfs_ is a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpio[cpio] archive that the kernel extracts
to a link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/filesystems/tmpfs.html[temporary
file system] created at boot.  The difference is subtle but important to many
of the internal operations of kernel initalization; for more details see
link:https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt[kernel
rootfs documentation].

While the _initrd_ approach is essentially obsolete, you may still see
references to it; confusingly the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

dracut creates _initramfs_ archives.

== dracut's approach

dracut creates an initramfs archive by copying tools and files from an installed
system and combining it with dracut modules, usually found on an installed
system in `/usr/lib/dracut/modules.d`.

Unlike other implementations, dracut hard-codes as little as possible into the
initramfs.  To keep the time required in the initramfs as little as possible,
instead of scripts hard-coded to do various things, dracut depends on on `udev`
to create device nodes.  When the rootfs's device node is available, we mount
and carry on.

Most of the initramfs generation functionality in dracut is provided by
generator modules that are sourced by the main dracut script to install
specific functionality into the initramfs.  They live in the `modules.d`
subdirectory, and use functionality provided by dracut-functions to do their
work.

== Mount preparations

dracut's initramfs starts only with the device name of the root file system (or
its UUID) and must discover everything else at boot time. A complex cascade of
tasks must be performed to get the root file system mounted:

* Any hardware drivers that the boot process depends on must be loaded. All
kernel modules for common storage devices are packed onto the initramfs and then
udev pulls in modules matching the computer's detected hardware.

* On systems which display a boot `rd.splash` screen, the video hardware must
be initialized and a user-space helper started to paint animations onto the
display in lockstep with the boot process.

* If the root file system is on NFS, dracut does then:
** Bring up the primary network interface.
** Invoke a DHCP client, with which it can obtain a DHCP lease.
** Extract the name of the NFS share and the address of the NFS server from the
lease.
** Mount the NFS share.

* If the root file system appears to be on a software RAID device, there is no
way of knowing which devices the RAID volume spans; the standard MD utilities
must be invoked to scan all available block devices with a raid signature and
bring the required ones online.

* If the root file system appears to be on a logical volume, the LVM utilities
must be invoked to scan for and activate the volume group containing it.

* If the root file system is on an encrypted block device:
** Invoke a helper script to prompt the user to type in a passphrase and/or
insert a hardware token (such as a smart card or a USB security dongle).

* Create a decryption target with the device mapper.

dracut uses link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev[udev], an event-driven
hotplug agent, which invokes helper programs as hardware devices, disk
partitions and storage volumes matching certain rules come online. This allows
discovery to run in parallel, and to progressively cascade into arbitrary
nestings of LVM, RAID or encryption to get at the root file system.

When the root file system finally becomes visible:

* Any maintenance tasks which cannot run on a mounted root file system
are done.
* The root file system is mounted read-only.
* Any processes which must continue running (such as the `rd.splash` screen helper
and its command FIFO) are hoisted into the newly-mounted root file system.

The final root file system cannot simply be mounted over /, since that would
make the scripts and tools on the initial root file system inaccessible for any
final cleanup tasks. On an initramfs, the initial root file system cannot be
rotated away. Instead, it is simply emptied and the final root file system
mounted over the top.

If the systemd module is used in the initramfs, the ordering of the services
started looks like xref:man/dracut.bootup.7.adoc[].

== Host v Default mode

Dracut can operate in two modes

host-only mode:: dracut will generate a smaller customized initramfs image
which contains only whatever is necessary to boot based on examining the
running system.

default mode:: dracut will generate a larger, but more generic, initramfs
image.  This is important for generic kernels, or if you are switching hardware
for an installed system.

== Dracut on shutdown

On a systemd driven system, the dracut initramfs is also used for the shutdown
procedure.  See xref:man/dracut-shutdown.service.8.adoc[] for details.

== History

dracut (pronounced: /ˈdreɪkət/) was the initial brainchild born out of late
night scheme of Farce Majeure, link:https://github.com/katzj[Jeremy Katz] and
link:https://lwn.net/Articles/317874/[Dave Jones] who also did the initial
implementation until link:https://github.com/haraldh[Harald Hoyer] took it
under his care in 2009 and continued its development from there
link:https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/commit/9371dcaba3c58377428eee44bd702fae7b2ab20e[on].

The project
link:https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/commit/ec9315e56222d38fdbfca5f8e47f05c156ce4927[started]
and was link:https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/17/318[announced] in 2008.

Some people inside Red Hat started to name their projects after cities and
villages around the developer headquarters of Red Hat in Westford,
Massachusetts.

So, dracut is named after the town

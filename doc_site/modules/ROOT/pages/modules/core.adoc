= Core dracut modules

The organization and categories of dracut modules below are only meant for
gaining better understanding of what each module does. In the dracut source
code, there are no specific types or categories for dracut modules.

* shell
* library (usually included by other dracut modules as a dependency and not directly by user)
* filesystems (kernel module and corresponding user-space utilities for a filesystem)
* device (kernel module and corresponding user space utilities for a device).
* kernel (only kernel modules, no user-space utilities)
* utils (no kernel module, only user-space utilities)
* meta (only for making decision which other modules to include)

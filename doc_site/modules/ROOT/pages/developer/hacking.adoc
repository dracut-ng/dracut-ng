= Dracut Developer Guidelines

Please make sure to follow our xref:developer/contributing.adoc[Contribution Guidelines].

== Source

Currently dracut-ng lives on github.com.

* https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng.git

Pull requests should be filed in this project

== Code Format

It is recommended, that you install a plugin for your editor, which reads in `.editorconfig`.
Additionally `emacs` and `vim` config files are provided for convenience.

To reformat C files use `astyle`:

[,console]
----
$ astyle --options=.astylerc <FILE>
----

For convenience there is also a Makefile `indent-c` target `make indent-c`.

To reformat shell files use `shfmt`:

[,console]
----
$ shfmt_version=3.2.4
$ wget "https://github.com/mvdan/sh/releases/download/v${shfmt_version}/shfmt_v${shfmt_version}_linux_amd64" -O shfmt
$ chmod u+x shfmt
$ ./shfmt -w -s .
----

or

[,console]
----
$ GO111MODULE=on go get mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt
$ $GOPATH/bin/shfmt -w -s .
----

or if `shfmt` is already in your `PATH`, use `make indent`.

Some IDEs already have support for shfmt.

For convenience the `make indent` Makefile target also calls shfmt, if it is in `$PATH`.

== Commit Messages

Commit messages should answer these questions:

What?::
  a short summary of what you changed in the subject line.
Why?::
  what the intended outcome of the change is (arguably the most important
  piece of information that should go into a message).
How?::
  if multiple approaches for achieving your goal were available, you also
  want to explain why you chose the used implementation strategy.  Note that
  you should not explain how your change achieves your goal in your commit
  message.  That should be obvious from the code itself.  If you cannot achieve
  that clarity with the used programming language, use comments within the code
  instead.

The commit message is primarily the place for documenting the why.

Commit message titles should follow https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[Conventional Commits].

Format is `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`, where `type` is one of:

* *fix*: A bug fix
* *feat*: A new feature
* *perf*: A code change that improves performance
* *refactor*: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* *style*: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* *test*: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* *docs*: Documentation only changes
* *revert*: Reverts a previous commit
* *chore*: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
* *build*: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* *ci*: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)

`scope` should be the module name (without numbers) or:

* *cli*: for the dracut command line interface
* *rt*: for the dracut initramfs runtime logic
* *functions*: for general purpose dracut functions

== Testsuite

=== In a container

[,console]
----
$ cd <DRACUT_SOURCE>
$ test/test.sh [CONTAINER] [TESTS]
----

with `[CONTAINER]` being one of the
https://github.com/orgs/dracut-ng/packages[github `dracut-ng` containers].
Default container is `fedora`.

If the container supports arm64, and the test.sh script is run on an arm64
enviroment, the test would also run using an arm64 container.

Run only specific test::
e.g. only runs the 10, 20 tests inside the default container.
+
[,console]
----
$ TESTS="10 11" test/test.sh
----

Run all tests on `ubuntu:rolling` in quiet mode (V=0):: {empty}
+
[,console]
----
$ V=0 test/test.sh ubuntu:rolling
----

Run test in verbose mode (enabled for GitHub Actions):: {empty}
+
[,console]
----
$ V=1 test/test.sh
----

Run test in extra verbose mode (enabled for debug logging):: {empty}
+
[,console]
----
$ V=2 test/test.sh
----

=== On bare metal

For the testsuite to pass, you will have to install at least the software packages
mentioned in the `test/container` Dockerfiles.

Run tests:: {empty}
+
[,console]
----
$ make clean check
----

Run only specific test::
e.g. only runs the 10, 11 tests.
+
[,console]
----
$ make TESTS="10 11" clean check
----

Debug a specific test case:: {empty}
+
[,console]
----
$ cd TEST-01-BASIC
$ make clean setup run
----

Run the test without doing the setup::
_change some kernel parameters in `test.sh`_
+
[,console]
----
$ make run
----

== Documentation

To build the documentation site run `make doc_site`.  This will be built and
published by CI on commit.

The documentation site is based on https://antora.org/[Antora].  By default
it will build via `npx` (install `nodejs`) or if you have Antora installed in
some other way, you can set `ANTORA_BIN`.

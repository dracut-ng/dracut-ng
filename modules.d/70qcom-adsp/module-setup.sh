# On Qualcomm sc8280xp and x1e laptops the kernel reboots the ADSP with new
# firmware because the BIOS loads ADSP firmware with limited functionality
# without sound or battery charge/status reading support.
#
# Unfortunately the ADSP also controls the TCPM (Type-C Port Manager) and
# rebooting the ADSP also resets the TCPM, causing any USB devices connected
# over Type-C ports to get disconnected as all devices on the USB bus are
# removed and re-enumerated.
#
# This breaks booting from USB-drives as the drive gets disconnected and
# re-enumerated as a new block device, leaving any filesystems mounted
# before the ADSP reset without any backing device.
#
# To workaround this, this module load the ADSP driver from a pre-udev hook
# so that the USB re-enumeration happens before the rootfs is mounted.
